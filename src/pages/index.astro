      <p>
        Hi! I am a CS graduate student! I have 2 years experience as an software developer where i created webapps with Angular, Python, dotnet and Node.js APIs. I have also worked with SQL and Oracle Databases.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am interested in everything tech. I love linux and virtualization (I use Arch with gpu pt to a windows vm :3). I am a big open-source/libre/FOSS enthusiast. I have been teaching myself Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Expect to see some Neural Networks soon&trade;.
    </p>

        <summary>My hyperfixations</summary>
        <p>I spend my freetime playing video games, watching anime/ reading manga or playing the guitar! I also love building custom keyboards (oh so expensive!) and drawing.</p>


        <p>I'm a nerd who has spent hours trying to get better at my hobbies. My dream guitar is a Les Paul Standard 50s in Heritage Cherry Sunburst or a cream white Stratocaster (Japanese please!).
          I have been looking into buying a vintage Greco or a Tokai Made in Japan guitar! </p>
        <p> As for custom keyboards, I have owned Bakenekos, FreeBird TKL and others. I really wanna own a Geon F1-8x or a TGR Jane someday (very creative, ik). I build all my keyboards with broken-in and lubed Cherry MX Blacks on either an aluminum or polycarb plate (bet no one expected this). I currently type on a CableCarDesigns Angel built with Creampaca frankenswitches on a polypropylene plate and it bangs! </p>
